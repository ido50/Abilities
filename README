NAME
    Abilities - Simple, hierarchical user authorization for web
    applications, with optional support for plan-based paid services.

SYNOPSIS
            use Abilities;

            # get a user object that consumed the Abilities role
            my $user = MyApp->get_user('username');
                
            # check if the user is able to do something
            if ($user->can_perform('something')) {
                    do_something();
            } else {
                    die "Hey you can't do that, you can only do ", join(', ', $user->abilities);
            }

DESCRIPTION
    Abilities is a simple yet powerful mechanism for authorizing users of
    web applications to perform certain actions in the app's code. This is
    an extension of the familiar role-based access control that is common in
    various systems and frameworks like Catalyst (See
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles for the role-based implementation
    and Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Abilities for the ability-based
    implementation that inspired this module).

    As opposed to the role-based access control - where users are allowed
    access to a certain feature (here called 'action') only through their
    association to a certain role that is hard-coded in the program's code -
    in ability-based acccess control, a list of actions is assigned to every
    user, and they are only allowed to perform these actions. Actions are
    not assigned by the developer during development, but rather by the
    end-user during deployment. This allows for much more flexibility, and
    also speeds up development, as you (the developer) do not need to think
    about who should be allowed to perform a certain action, and can easily
    grant access later-on after deployment (assuming you're also the
    end-user).

    Abilities to perform certain actions can be given to a user
    specifically, or via roles the user can assume (as in role-based access
    control). For example, if user 'user01' is a member of role 'admin', and
    this user wishes to perform some action, for example 'delete_foo', then
    they will only be able to do so if the 'delete_foo' ability was given to
    either the user itself or the 'admin' role itself. Furthermore, roles
    can be assigned other roles; for example, roles 'mods' and 'editors' can
    be assigned _inside_ role 'mega_mods'. Users of the 'mega_mods' role
    will assume all actions owned by the 'mods' and 'editors' roles.

    A commonly known use-case for this type of access control is message
    boards, where the administrator might wish to create roles with certain
    actions and associate users with the roles (more commonly called 'user
    groups'); for example, the admin can create an 'editor' role, giving
    users of this role the ability to edit and delete posts, but not any
    other administrative action. So in essence, this type of access control
    relieves the developer from deciding who gets to do what and passes
    these decisions to the end-user, which might be necessary in certain
    situations.

    The Abilities module is implemented as a Moose role. In order to be able
    to use this mechanism, web applications must implement a user management
    system that will consume this role. More specifically, a user class and
    a role class must be implemented, consuming this role. Entities is a
    reference implementation that can be used by web applications, or just
    as an example of an ability-based authorization system. Entities::User
    and Entities::Role are the user and role classes that consume the
    Abilities role in the Entities distribution.

  PAID, SUBSCRIPTION-BASED WEB SERVICES
    Apart from the scenario described above, this module also provides
    optional support for subscription-based web services, such as those
    where customers subscribe to a certain paid (or free, doesn't matter)
    plan from a list of available plans (GitHub is an example of such a
    service). This functionality is also implemented as a role, in the
    Abilities::Features module provided with this distribution. Read its
    documentation for detailed information.

REQUIRED METHODS
    Classes that consume this role are required to implement the following
    methods:

  roles()
    Returns a list of all roles that a user object belongs to, or a role
    object inherits from. The list must contain references to the role
    objects, not just their names.

  actions()
    Returns a list of all actions that a user object has been explicitely
    granted, or that a role object has been granted. The list must contain
    references to the action objects, not just their names.

  is_super()
    This is a boolean attribute that both user and role objects should have.
    If a user/role object has a true value for this attribute, then they
    will be able to perform any action, even if it wasn't granted to them.

METHODS
    Classes that consume this role will have the following methods available
    for them:

  can_perform( $action_name | @action_names )
    Receives the name of an action (or names of actions), and returns a true
    value if the user/role can perform the provided action(s). If more than
    one actions are passed, a true value will be returned only if the
    user/role can perform ALL of these actions.

  belongs_to( $role_name | @role_names )
  takes_from( $role_name | @role_names )
    The above two methods are actually the same. The names are meant to
    differentiate between user objects (first case) and role objects (second
    case).

    These methods receive a role name (or names). In case of a user object,
    the method will return a true value if the user is a direct member of
    the provided role. In case multiple role names were provided, a true
    value will be returned only if the user is a member of ALL of these
    roles. Only direct association is checked, so the user must be
    specifically assigned to the provided role, and not to a role that
    inherits from that role (see "inherits_from_role()" instead.

    In case of a role object, this method will return a true value if the
    role directly consumes the abilities of the provided role. In case
    multiple role names were provided, a true value will be returned only if
    the role directly consumes ALL of these roles. Like in case of a user,
    only direct association is checked, so inheritance doesn't count.

  inherits_from_role( $role_name | @role_names )
    Receives the name of a role (or names of roles), and returns a true
    value if the user/role inherits the abilities of the provided role. If
    more than one roles are passed, a true value will be returned only if
    the user/role inherits from ALL of these roles.

    This method takes inheritance into account, so if a user was directly
    assigned to the 'admins' role, and the 'admins' role inherits from the
    'devs' role, then inherits_from_role('devs') will return true for that
    user.

  all_abilities()
    Returns a list of all actions that a user/role can perform, either due
    to direct association or due to inheritance.

INTERNAL METHODS
    These methods are only to be used internally.
